# [Driving Log](https://isakw2004.github.io/drive-tracker/ "# Driving Log")

This is a simple and installable Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking student driving hours. It tracks total hours, night hours, and essential skills practiced.

## **Features**

##### Simple and Effective Design

Driving Log makes use of Material Design's easy to use components and a centrally controlled user interface to eliminate annoyances and distractions in the driver's seat.

##### Helpful Where It Counts

Take the guesswork out of learning to drive. In the United States, Driving Log will automatically set provisional license requirements based on what state you're in. Passengers can easily monitor vehicle speed without looking over the driver's shoulder, and data can be easily exported and shared to new devices.

##### No Tracking, Telemetry, or Useless Accounts

This app is meant to help you track your student driving hours, not help anyone else track you. None of your data or tracking information is stored anywhere but your own device. If you're reading this, you most likely know that the source code is open to everyone, so feel free to poke around.
